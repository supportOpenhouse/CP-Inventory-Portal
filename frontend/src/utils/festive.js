// Diwali decor window, by the viewer's own computer clock (local time),
// 6–10 Nov 2026 inclusive. Outside it every festive element is simply not
// rendered — so fireworks.webp is never even downloaded — and the app looks
// normal. Mirrors Direct_Inventory and direct_demand_portal (same dates, same
// assets). The .webp files are outside the PWA precache globs (vite.config.js),
// so the service worker doesn't pull them in either. Diwali moves each year:
// update FROM/TO, or delete this file, its isFestive() call sites and the
// "festive" block at the end of styles.css.
const FROM = new Date(2026, 10, 6);   // 6 Nov 2026 00:00 local (months are 0-based)
const TO = new Date(2026, 10, 11);    // 11 Nov 00:00 local — exclusive, so 10 Nov is the last day

// Evaluated per render, not once at load: a tab left open past midnight on the
// 10th drops the decor on its next re-render.
export const isFestive = (now = new Date()) => now >= FROM && now < TO;
